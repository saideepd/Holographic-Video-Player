# Holographic-Video-Player
A Holographic Video Player which enables users to view any video as a Holographic video which is projected on a glass pyramid

This software was developed as a part of our Final Year Project in Diploma in Computer Engineering and was assigned to us by L&T Infotech as an Induatrial Project.

### The real inspiration behind this project : Mrwhosetheboss

We were inspired by this video by Mrwhosetheboss and were interestd in such technology. There were such videos available on internet but they were made using proessional video editing softwares. Such softwares can't be used by common people. Our main target was developing a software which can be used by common people who can get such videos easily without any professional skills of video editing. And we succeded in developing such software and here are the results.

#### Note: 
This project was developed 1.5 years back in 2016 but we hadn't uploaded it as we were not so familiar with open source software develpoment and GitHub.
